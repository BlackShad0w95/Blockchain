# 1) Write a short Python script which queries the user for input (infinite loop with exit possibility) and writes the input to a file.
# # 2) Add another option to your user interface: The user should be able to output the data stored in the file in the terminal.
# # 3) Store user input in a list (instead of directly adding it to the file) and write that list to the file â€“ both with pickle and json.
# # 4) Adjust the logic to load the file content to work with pickled/ json data.
